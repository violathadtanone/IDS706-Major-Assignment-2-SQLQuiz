# IDS 706 2nd Major Assignment: Build a SQL Quiz with Supabase - 20 Oct 2026

## Project Description
This is 2nd major assignment under IDS 706 with the purpose to build a small system: a hosted database, sign-in, automation, and a SQL quiz that runs against live data.

## SQL Quiz - School Lunch Program Analysis
- This SQL quiz uses a small dataset about North Carolina schools, students, and school lunch records.
- Five questions are worth 20 points total and are answered by writing SQL queries against the live database. 
- Hints are available for guidance
- Grading is based on the results returned by each query
- Sign-in is required to begin the quiz.
- Link access to SQL Quiz: https://violathadtanone.github.io/IDS706-Major-Assignment-2-SQLQuiz/
<br><br>

## Overall Setup Instructions
### 1. Create GitHub repository
General:
- Name the repository with `IDS706-Major-Assignment-2-SQLQuiz`.

Configuration:
- Add README - Toggle On option.
- Add .gitignore - Select Python.
- Proceed to create repository.

### 2. Clone repository in VS Code
- Open Command Palette and select `Git: Clone`.
- Paste GitHub repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/violathadtanone/IDS706-Major-Assignment-2-SQLQuiz).
- Select the local folder to continue the development.

### 3. Set up a Python virtual environment
- Create and activate the virtual environment on Terminal with the code below:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- Upgrade pip to ensure that it is compatible with the current Python version before installing other packages.
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 4. Install Node.js
- Node.js is used to run JavaScript outside a web browser, especially for server-side applications. In Node.js, JavaScript can build web servers, create APIs, access databases, and work with files.
- Follow https://nodejs.org/en/download to install Node.js

## Supabase Setup Instructions - Create pre-requisite files
### 1. .env
- This stores the database connection settings used by the local Python script (query.py). The live quiz uses separate Supabase configuration and secrets.
- After creating the Supabase database, open the Session Pooler connection details in Supabase and use those values to fill in the value based on the format below:
```
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres.<your-project-ref>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your-database-password>
DB_HOST=aws-0-<your-region>.pooler.supabase.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_SSLMODE=require
```

### 2. init.sql
- This contains the SQL needed to create the quiz tables and load the initial dataset into PostgreSQL.
- It is intended for setting up a new or empty Supabase database.

### 3. requirements.txt
- Create a new file called `requirements.txt` in the project root and add packages below in the file.
```
psycopg2-binary
python-dotenv
```
- Install the requirements in the virtual environment `(.venv) (base)` with the code below in Terminal:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. query.py
- This is a small Python script used to test the PostgreSQL connection and demonstrate basic database operations. 
- It connects to Supabase using the values from .env and uses parameterized SQL for safe INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE examples.

### 5. .gitignore
- This tells Git which local files should not be committed to the repository.
- .env must be listed in this file to keep the database password and other local credentials out of GitHub.
```
.env
```

## Overall Project Architecture & Core Components

![Diagram](images/project-architecture.svg)
The project uses a simple three-part setup:
- Local development: query.py connects to the hosted PostgreSQL database using credentials stored in .env. The connection uses the Supabase Session Pooler with sslmode=require.
- Supabase: PostgreSQL stores the schools, students, and meals tables. Supabase also provides authentication and the backend used to run and save quiz queries.
- GitHub: GitHub Pages hosts the quiz website, while GitHub Actions verifies that the hosted database is reachable using a GitHub Secret.


### 1. Authentication
- The quiz uses Supabase Magic Link authentication. A user enters an email address and receives a sign-in link.
- Signed-out users cannot run SQL queries or save quiz answers. After signing in, the quiz allows the user to run queries against the hosted database and save progress.

### 2. GitHub Actions
- Verify hosted database workflow checks that GitHub can connect to the hosted Supabase PostgreSQL database and that the students table contains data.
- Database connection is stored as a GitHub repository secret named: DATABASE_URL
- Workflow uses the Supabase Session Pooler connection with SSL. Database passwords are not stored in the workflow file or committed to GitHub.
- Workflow runs automatically on pushes to main and can also be started manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

### 3. Additional features
- Parameterized queries: Application-owned database operations use parameters rather than f-string or string-concatenated SQL, helping reduce SQL injection risk.  
- Audit logging: Query runs and saved quiz answers are recorded in quiz_audit_log, including who performed the action, what was run or saved, and when it occurred.  
- Audit-log integrity: The restricted quiz role cannot modify the audit history. Direct UPDATE, DELETE, and TRUNCATE attempts are blocked by PostgreSQL permissions.

## SQL Quiz Instructions
1. Open https://violathadtanone.github.io/IDS706-Major-Assignment-2-SQLQuiz/
2. Click sign in and open Magic Link sent to your email.
3. Select one of the five SQL questions.
4. Write a SQL query in the query editor.
5. Use Run Query to view the results from the live Supabase database.
6. Use the hint when needed to compare the expected SQL approach and expected result.
7. Use Check My SQL to check the returned result.
8. Save quiz progress while signed in.
